## Additional Information
This activity was completed in two parts.  
In Part 1, a basic LibraryItem class was created with validation, documentation, unit tests and a client program.  
In Part 2, the class was extended by adding new attributes, updating validation, expanding documentation, updating unit tests based on a revised test plan and modifying the client program to use the updated constructor.
